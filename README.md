# Dimensionality Reduction Application

# Description
The Dimensionality Reduction application allows to convert a large and complex data set into a n-dimensional data set and visualize the result. The two techniques to reduce dimensionality of data that are used are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis for Mixed Data (FAMD). Not only does it allow for a more intuitive understanding of what the data is telling in the graph, it would also reduces the time it takes to train a machine learning model while preserving important information.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65356826/118901383-5db84d80-b8d0-11eb-91fc-de778fad8131.png)
