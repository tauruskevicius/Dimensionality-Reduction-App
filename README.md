# Description
The Dimensionality Reduction application allows to convert a large and complex data set into a n-dimensional data set and visualize the result. The two techniques to reduce dimensionality of data that are used are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis for Mixed Data (FAMD). Not only does it allow for a more intuitive understanding of what the data is telling in the graph, it would also reduces the time it takes to train a machine learning model while preserving important information.

# How to open it?
Upon the download of the files, the application needs to be opened via the terminal window.  The application.py file contains dependecies that will be imported properly only if it is opened via the terminal.  

# Usage
* Open the application
* Import data
* Preview data
* Enter the number of dimensions to reduce data to
* Apply algorithm
* Inspect graph
* Color the graph based on column values
* Download reduced data set/graph


# Known Issues
* The application crashes with certain data mixed data sets (contains categorical and numerical values)
* No legend with the colored graph
